# server-side-samples

If you are reading this, chances are you are looking at samples of my work with the intent of hiring my services to develop code for you.

The folders in this repo do not actually build an application.

This repo contains code samples of my work on the server side.  A similar repo called **client-side-samples** showcases representative work I have done on the client side.

The truth is I don't get much time to work outside of my paying projects so I don't have projects with which to showcase my work, as most code belongs to the respective project owners.

Feel free to peruse and look around to get an idea of my coding style.

Thanks!

Carlos
